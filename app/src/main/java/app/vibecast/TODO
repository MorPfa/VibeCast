TASKS:



Next tasks:
implement logic to fetch current song so user can be redirected to web page if app not installed
move firebase logic from activity/ fragment to data layer
figure out how to track number of songs played (increment counter if song was played for more than 50%??)



General Firebase:
persist and set profile picture
improve firebase sync performance by checking size instead of iterating over all items

allow user to save songs (heart icon in top app bar / save track name, artist and uri display in recyclerview and
send intent to spotify app or open in browser when card is clicked)
optimize image accuracy (maybe go back to GET /search/photos endpoint and combine query with collections)
configure pro guard r8
replace splash screen fragment with activity
