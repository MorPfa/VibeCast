Today:
Look into actually downloading images instead of just favoriting them
prepare for application for request limit raise
- hotlinking works
- download events dont work yet
Look into improving api calls by using call etc




give nav destinations their own viewmodel
fix landscape orientation for gallery fragment
fix top of image card in gallery fragment
-> both of those can be fixed by fixing the way the fragment/ activity gets recreated on config changes



Make another attempt at autocomplete but with autocomplete intent


Allow user to choose themes
fix bug where image gets updated twice
optimize image accuracy (maybe go back to GET /search/photos endpoint and combine query with collections)
(re)write unit tests
