Today:
Make it so that holding down on image card shows image



fix landscape orientation for gallery fragment
fix top of image card in gallery fragment
-> both of those can be fixed by fixing the way the fragment/ activity gets recreated on config changes





Look into actually downloading images instead of just favoriting them
Make another attempt at autocomplete but with autocomplete intent


Allow user to choose themes
fix bug where image gets updated twice
optimize image accuracy (maybe go back to GET /search/photos endpoint and combine query with collections)
(re)write unit tests

consider data binding
FIND APPROPRIATE DEFAULT IMAGE FOR EACH WEATHER CONDITION IN CASE OF NO INTERNET
