Today:

prepare for application for request limit raise
fix landscape orientation for gallery fragment
fix top of image card in gallery fragment
-> both of those can be fixed by fixing the way the fragment/ activity gets recreated on config changes


fix invalid input crashing app
Look into actually downloading images instead of just favoriting them
Make another attempt at autocomplete but with autocomplete intent


Allow user to choose themes
fix bug where image gets updated twice
optimize image accuracy (maybe go back to GET /search/photos endpoint and combine query with collections)
(re)write unit tests

consider data binding
