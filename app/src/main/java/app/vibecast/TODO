Today:
fix permission options
fix error warning icon
replace placeholders with dashes



fix landscape orientation for gallery fragment
fix top of image card in gallery fragment
-> both of those can be fixed by fixing the way the fragment/ activity gets recreated on config changes

change the way the image gets loaded/ updated maybe through viemodel livedata instead of fragment


Make it so that holding down on image card shows image
Look into actually downloading images instead of just favoriting them



Allow user to choose themes
fix bug where image gets updated twice
optimize image accuracy (maybe go back to GET /search/photos endpoint and combine query with collections)
(re)write unit tests

consider data binding
