Today:
look into fixing weather entity


Make it so that users can get images based on locations or weather
optimize image accuracy (maybe go back to GET /search/photos endpoint and combine query with collections)
(re)write unit tests
fix saved locations not being available right after saving location


CREATE CUSTOM ACTIONBAR FOR FRAGMENT
consider data binding
FIND APPROPRIATE DEFAULT IMAGE FOR EACH WEATHER CONDITION IN CASE OF NO INTERNET
